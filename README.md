# Avalon

A companion app that eliminates the need for Pre Game Ritual because it's awkward to use in public places.  
"Everyone close your eyes and extend your hand info a fist in front of you."    
"Minions of Mordred open your eyes and look around so that you know all agents of Evil".  
Really?

## How to use

Enter your names, set roles, press start, each player reveals own role, remember names as needed. Done.
